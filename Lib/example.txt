For many Americans, presidential elections essentially end when a candidate is declared the winner. This year, after several days of tense waiting and watching, The Associated Press called the presidential race Saturday morning, declaring that former Vice President Joe Biden will become the 46th president of the United States.

He secured his win with crucial victories in swing states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, will make history as the first Black woman and the first Asian American woman to be elected vice president.

But the journey from candidate to president-elect, and then president, is not quite complete. There are still a number of important steps yet to play out from November through January.
